# *Hey there, this is my First Login Page*
### *In this simple project, i used new components of my learning, like:*
###   *Input tag (Html5), and how implement it to common systems*
###   *Sequential classes (CSS) and how to best manipulate them to form details*
###   *The "selector" ::hover in Css, to introduce simple animations*
###   *Minimal transitions*
###   *And the principal, a better understanding of how the base of the front end works, how each of the "positions", the "padding" and so on.*

###   *As an advice from a friend, I'm going to start introducing the concepts learned here, like a blog*
###   *Today, I'm going to explain the properties of Position: (CSS)*
###  *Position: static*
####  -*This is the default value of the html element*
###  *Position: fixed*
####  -*This is fixed on the page, regardless of scrolling.*
###  *Position: absolute*
####  -*Position the element based on the father element (As long as he has a position of static)*
###  *Position: relative*
####  -*This different from the absolute, uses itself as a position reference*
###  *Position: sticky*
####  -*It works as a relative, until it reaches a certain limit*
####  -*After that it will have a fixed behavior*
###  *Top, bottom, left and right*
####  -*They are ways to manipulate, in pixels or other units, the distance of the object from its father (absolute) element or from the page itself*
####  -*You can find an example of this manipulation in my project*
